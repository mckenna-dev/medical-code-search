# STANDARDIZATION PLAN
==============================

## APPROACH
1. **High Priority**: Standardize common patterns first (affecting most files)
2. **Medium Priority**: Handle project-specific patterns
3. **Low Priority**: Deal with unique/problematic files individually

## COMMON PATTERNS TO STANDARDIZE

### Priority 1: 130 files
**Pattern**: MedCodeId, Observations, SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID, Term
**Projects**: COMPUTE
**Suggested mapping**:
  - MedCodeId -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Observations -> observations <-this is the primary
  - SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID -> snomed_ct_concept_id <-this is the primary
  - Term -> term <-this is the primary

### Priority 2: 121 files
**Pattern**: Flag_L1_L2, Flag_classifyL1, Flag_classifyL2, MedCodeID, Notes, Order, Term
**Projects**: CanBack
**Suggested mapping**:
  - Flag_L1_L2 -> ?  <- this can be ignored
  - Flag_classifyL1 -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - Flag_classifyL2 -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - MedCodeID -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Notes -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - Order -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - Term -> term <- this is the primary

### Priority 3: 18 files
**Pattern**: MedCodeId, Observations, SnomedCTConceptId, Term
**Projects**: Consultation_Catergorisation, Evaluation_of_Anaemia_in_a_Primary_Care_Population
**Suggested mapping**:
  - MedCodeId -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Observations -> observations <-this is the primary
  - SnomedCTConceptId -> snomed_ct_concept_id
  - Term -> term <-this is the primary

### Priority 4: 15 files
**Pattern**: Codelist_Name, Description, Med_Code_Id, Observations, SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID, Term
**Projects**: COMPUTE
**Suggested mapping**:
  - Codelist_Name -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored
  - Description -> term  <- this can be ignored, or made into its own column
  - Med_Code_Id -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Observations -> observations <-this is the primary
  - SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID -> snomed_ct_concept_id <-this is the primary
  - Term -> term <-this is the primary

### Priority 5: 10 files
**Pattern**: MedCodeId, Observations, SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID, Term, clinicalevents, databasebuild, immunisationevents, readcode, readterm, referralevents, testevents
**Projects**: ID_Fracture
**Suggested mapping**:
  - MedCodeId -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Observations -> observations <-this is the primary
  - SNOMED_CT_Concept_ID -> snomed_ct_concept_id <-this is the primary
  - Term -> term <-this is the primary
  - clinicalevents -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - databasebuild -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - immunisationevents -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - readcode -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored
  - readterm -> term <- this can be ignored
  - referralevents -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - testevents -> ? <- this can be ignored

### Priority 6: 9 files
**Pattern**: cleansedreadcode, medcodeid, originalreadcode, release, snomedctconceptid, snomedctdescriptionid, term
**Projects**: Respiratory_infection_related_cardiovascular_disease
**Suggested mapping**:
  - cleansedreadcode -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored or modified to a "readcode" column
  - medcodeid -> med_code_id <- this is the primary
  - originalreadcode -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored
  - release -> ? <- this can be ignored
  - snomedctconceptid -> snomed_ct_concept_id <- this is the primary
  - snomedctdescriptionid -> term <- this can be ignored
  - term -> term <-this is the primary

### Priority 7: 5 files
**Pattern**: MedCodeId, Observations, SnomedCTConceptId, Term, Unnamed: 4
**Projects**: Evaluation_of_Anaemia_in_a_Primary_Care_Population
**Suggested mapping**:
  - MedCodeId -> med_code_id <-this is the primary
  - Observations -> observations <-this is the primary
  - SnomedCTConceptId -> snomed_ct_concept_id <-this is the primary
  - Term -> term <-this is the primary
  - Unnamed: 4 -> ? <- this can be ignored

### Priority 8: 5 files
**Pattern**: cleansedreadcode, medcodeid, originalreadcode, release, snomedctconceptid, snomedctdescriptionid, term, term2
**Projects**: Respiratory_infection_related_cardiovascular_disease
**Suggested mapping**:
  - cleansedreadcode -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored
  - medcodeid -> med_code_id <- this is the primary
  - originalreadcode -> med_code_id <- this can be ignored
  - release -> ? <- this can be dropped
  - snomedctconceptid -> snomed_ct_concept_id
  - snomedctdescriptionid -> term <-this can be ignored
  - term -> term <- this should be the primary
  - term2 -> term <- this could be set to a secondary
